|Terms/Abbreviations |Meaning 

|Console Access Library
|SDK that provides access to the Console for AITRIOS

|Codespaces
|Cloud-hosted and containerized VS Code environment from GitHub

|===

== Reference materials
* Codespaces documentation (external link)
** https://docs.github.com/ja/codespaces

== Expected use case
* Provide a Codespaces development environment for Python.
** Users can launch Codespaces from the repository and get a development environment for Python with SDK-provided libraries and tools to aid development.

== Functional overview/Algorithm
=== Functional overview
* Users can launch Codespaces from the repository and get a development environment for Python.
** As an editor, VS Code's UI runs in the browser.

* Provide an environment in which SDK-provided libraries required for application development can be used.
** Add submodules from the GitHub repository to the environment.

* Provide an environment where development aids can be used.
** Add extensions to the environment to facilitate development work, such as input completion and debugging aids.

=== Algorithm
. Build a container environment using a specified Python base image.
. Visit the VS Code's marketplace to install the extension.
** Python + 
Features for the Python development environment are available.
** Pylance + 
Input completion is available in the Python environment.
** Jupyter
** Jupyter Keymap + 
Jupyter Notebook is available on VS Code as a debugging aid for Python development.

. Run shell scripts to add libraries to the environment as submodules.
** Console Access Library + 
Provide access to the Console for AITRIOS.

=== Under what condition
* You have access to Codespaces. +
* You have access to the private repository for the Console Access Library.

=== API
* None

=== Others exclusive conditions/Specifications
* None

== User interface specifications
=== How to start 
* Procedures to build an environment with Codespaces + 
User forks the development environment (repository) and launches Codespaces on the replicated repository. After launch, a prep screen provided by Codespaces is displayed while the environment is being built.

== API parameters in each block
